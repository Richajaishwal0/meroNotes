Here's a simplified and structured approach to implementing a **B-Tree-Based Queue System**:

---

### Pseudocode for the B-Tree-Based Queue System

1. **Define B-Tree Node Structure**:
   - Each node has:
     - `keys[]`: Array of keys stored in the node.
     - `children[]`: Array of child pointers.
     - `isLeaf`: Boolean indicating if the node is a leaf.
     - `numKeys`: Current number of keys in the node.

2. **Function: Split Child**
   - `parent`: The node whose child is full.
   - `i`: Index of the child to split.
   - `child`: The full child node.
   - Create a new node `newChild` to hold the last `t-1` keys of `child`.
   - If `child` is not a leaf, move its last `t` children to `newChild`.
   - Insert `newChild` into `parent.children` at index `i + 1`.
   - Move the middle key of `child` to `parent`.
   - Update `child` and `parent`'s key counts.

3. **Function: Insert Non-Full Node**
   - `node`: The current node where we want to insert the key.
   - `key`: The key to be inserted.
   - If `node` is a leaf:
     - Insert `key` into `node.keys[]` at the correct position.
     - Increment `node.numKeys`.
   - Else:
     - Find the correct child to insert the key.
     - If the child is full, call `splitChild()` to make space.
     - Recur on the correct child to insert the key.

4. **Function: Insert Key**
   - `key`: The key to insert into the B-Tree.
   - If `root` is full:
     - Create a new node `newRoot`.
     - `newRoot` becomes the new root, and `root` becomes its child.
     - Call `splitChild()` on `newRoot` to split `root`.
     - Call `insertNonFull()` on `newRoot` to insert the key.
     - Set `root = newRoot`.
   - Else:
     - Call `insertNonFull()` on `root`.

5. **Function: Delete Key (Simplified)**
   - `key`: The key to delete from the B-Tree.
   - If the key is in a leaf node:
     - Remove the key directly.
   - If the key is in an internal node:
     - If the preceding or succeeding child has at least `t` keys:
       - Replace the key with the predecessor or successor and delete recursively.
     - Else:
       - Merge the key and children, then delete from the merged node.
   - If the key is not found, recur down the tree.
   - Ensure the child node has at least `t` keys before descending.

6. **Function: In-Order Traversal**
   - If `node` is not `NULL`:
     - Traverse `node.children[0]`.
     - For each key in `node.keys[]`:
       - Print the key.
       - Traverse the corresponding child in `node.children[]`.

7. **Main Function**
   - Initialize `root` as `NULL`.
   - For each `customerNumber` in the input sequence:
     - `InsertKey(customerNumber)`.
   - Perform an in-order traversal to print the numbers in sorted order.

---

### Summary of the Approach
- The B-Tree keeps keys sorted and balanced, optimizing insertion and deletion.
- Splitting and merging ensure that the tree remains balanced.
- An in-order traversal is used to retrieve the customer numbers in the correct order.
