### Pseudocode for Dijkstra's Algorithm

1. **Define Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented by an adjacency matrix or adjacency list where:
     - `graph[u][v]` stores the weight of the edge between node `u` and node `v`.
     - If no edge exists, the weight is set to infinity (∞).

2. **Define Data Structures**:
   - `dist[]`: Array to store the shortest distance from the source node to each node, initialized to infinity (∞), except the source node which is set to 0.
   - `visited[]`: Boolean array to track whether a node has been visited or not, initialized to `false`.
   - `previous[]`: Array to store the previous node for each node in the shortest path, initialized to `NULL`.

3. **Function: Find Minimum Distance Node**
   - Initialize `minDist = ∞` and `minNode = -1`.
   - For each node `u`:
     - If `visited[u] = false` and `dist[u] < minDist`:
       - Set `minDist = dist[u]` and `minNode = u`.
   - Return `minNode`.

4. **Function: Dijkstra's Algorithm**
   - Initialize `dist[]` to infinity and `visited[]` to `false`.
   - Set the distance of the source node to 0: `dist[source] = 0`.
   - For each node `u`:
     - Find the node `u` with the minimum distance that has not been visited (use `Find Minimum Distance Node`).
     - Mark `u` as visited: `visited[u] = true`.
     - For each neighboring node `v` of `u`:
       - If `v` is not visited and `dist[u] + weight(u, v) < dist[v]`:
         - Update `dist[v]`: `dist[v] = dist[u] + weight(u, v)`.
         - Set `previous[v] = u` to store the path.

5. **Function: Reconstruct Path**
   - Initialize an empty list `path[]` to store the shortest path.
   - Start at the destination node and trace back using the `previous[]` array:
     - While `destination != NULL`:
       - Insert `destination` at the beginning of `path[]`.
       - Set `destination = previous[destination]`.
   - Return `path[]`.

6. **Main Function**
   - Input: Graph, source node, destination node.
   - Call `Dijkstra's Algorithm` to calculate the shortest path from `source` to all other nodes.
   - Call `Reconstruct Path` to find the shortest path from the source to the destination.

### Summary of the Approach
- Dijkstra’s algorithm calculates the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.
- The algorithm repeatedly selects the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, updates its neighbors, and tracks the shortest path.
- The reconstructed path can be obtained by tracing the `previous[]` array from the destination node back to the source node.

This approach ensures efficient computation of the shortest path in graphs and is widely used in routing and pathfinding applications.
