### Pseudocode for Skip List

1. **Define Skip List Node Structure**:
   - Each node has:
     - `value`: The value stored in the node.
     - `forward[]`: Array of pointers, where `forward[i]` points to the node at level `i`.
     - `level`: The highest level (or depth) of the node.

2. **Function: Create Skip List**
   - Initialize a `skipList` with a header node having `value = NULL` and `level = 0`.
   - Set the `skipList`'s maximum level (`maxLevel`) and probability factor for creating new levels.

3. **Function: Random Level Generator**
   - Initialize a variable `level = 0`.
   - While a random probability (less than a threshold) holds, increment `level`.
   - Return `level`.

4. **Function: Insert Value**
   - Initialize `update[]` array to store pointers to the nodes that need to be updated.
   - Start at the highest level of the `skipList` and traverse downwards:
     - For each level, move forward while `current.forward[level]` value is less than the value to insert.
     - Store the pointer to the current node in `update[]`.
   - Create a new node with the given value and a random level generated by `Random Level Generator`.
   - For each level from `0` to the new node's level:
     - Update the `forward[]` pointers of the nodes in `update[]` to insert the new node in the list.
   - If the new nodeâ€™s level exceeds the current `maxLevel`, update `maxLevel`.

5. **Function: Search Value**
   - Start at the highest level of the `skipList` and traverse downwards:
     - For each level, move forward while `current.forward[level]` value is less than the value being searched.
   - If `current.forward[0]` is the target value, return the node.
   - If not, return `NULL`.

6. **Function: Delete Value**
   - Initialize `update[]` array to store pointers to the nodes that need to be updated.
   - Start at the highest level of the `skipList` and traverse downwards:
     - For each level, move forward while `current.forward[level]` value is less than the value to delete.
     - Store the pointer to the current node in `update[]`.
   - If the node containing the value is found, adjust the `forward[]` pointers of the nodes in `update[]` to remove the target node.
   - If the node was at the highest level, update `maxLevel`.

7. **Function: Traverse Skip List**
   - Start from the header node and traverse through the first node at each level:
     - For each node, print its `value`.

8. **Main Function**
   - Initialize `skipList`.
   - For each value to be inserted:
     - Call `Insert Value`.
   - For each value to be searched:
     - Call `Search Value` and print the result.
   - For each value to be deleted:
     - Call `Delete Value`.

### Summary of the Approach
- The Skip List provides an efficient, probabilistic alternative to balanced trees, offering logarithmic search, insertion, and deletion times.
- It uses multiple levels of linked lists to allow for faster traversal by skipping over portions of the list, with each node having a random level that determines its reach.
- The `Insert`, `Search`, and `Delete` operations take advantage of these levels to speed up operations.
