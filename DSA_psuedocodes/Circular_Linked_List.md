### Pseudocode for Circular Linked List

1. **Define Circular Linked List Node Structure**:
   - Each node has:
     - `value`: The data stored in the node.
     - `next`: Pointer to the next node in the list.
   - The last node’s `next` points back to the head node, creating a circular structure.

2. **Function: Create New Node**
   - Create a new node with the given `value`.
   - Set `next` to `NULL`.
   - Return the newly created node.

3. **Function: Insert Value at Beginning**
   - Create a new node with the given `value`.
   - If the list is empty (head is `NULL`):
     - Set the new node’s `next` to itself (the only node in the list).
     - Set the head to the new node.
   - Otherwise:
     - Set the new node’s `next` to the head node.
     - Traverse to the last node (where `next` points to the head).
     - Set the last node’s `next` to the new node.
     - Set the head to the new node.

4. **Function: Insert Value at End**
   - If the list is empty (head is `NULL`), call `Insert Value at Beginning`.
   - Otherwise, start at the head node and traverse to the last node (where `next` points to the head).
     - Create a new node with the given `value`.
     - Set the last node’s `next` to the new node.
     - Set the new node’s `next` to the head node.

5. **Function: Delete Node by Value**
   - If the list is empty (head is `NULL`), return (nothing to delete).
   - If the head node’s `value` matches the given `value`:
     - Traverse to the last node (where `next` points to the head).
     - Set the head to the next node.
     - Set the last node’s `next` to the new head.
   - Otherwise, start from the head node and traverse the list:
     - For each node, check if `node.next.value == value`.
     - If found:
       - Set `node.next` to `node.next.next` (removes the node).
   - If the node is not found, return `NULL`.

6. **Function: Search Value in List**
   - Start from the head node:
     - If `node.value == value`, return the node (value found).
     - Move to the next node (`node = node.next`).
     - Continue until you loop back to the head node.
   - If the end of the list is reached (`node == head`), return `NULL`.

7. **Function: Traverse the List**
   - Start from the head node:
     - While the current node is not equal to the head node:
       - Print the node’s `value`.
       - Move to the next node (`node = node.next`).
     - Once the traversal reaches the head node again, stop.

8. **Function: Get Length of List**
   - Initialize a counter `length = 0`.
   - Start from the head node:
     - While the current node is not equal to the head node:
       - Increment the counter.
       - Move to the next node.
   - Return the `length`.

9. **Main Function**
   - Initialize `head` as `NULL`.
   - For each value to be inserted at the beginning:
     - Call `Insert Value at Beginning`.
   - For each value to be inserted at the end:
     - Call `Insert Value at End`.
   - For each value to be searched:
     - Call `Search Value` and print the result.
   - For each value to be deleted:
     - Call `Delete Node by Value`.
   - Perform a traversal to print the list.

### Summary of the Approach
- A **Circular Linked List** is a variation of a linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
- This structure makes it easier to traverse the list continuously from any point, but care must be taken to avoid infinite loops when traversing.
- The time complexity for operations like insertion, deletion, and searching is `O(n)` in the worst case, but the circular structure allows for continuous traversal from any node.
