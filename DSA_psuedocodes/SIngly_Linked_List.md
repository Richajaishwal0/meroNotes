### Pseudocode for Singly Linked List

1. **Define Linked List Node Structure**:
   - Each node has:
     - `value`: The data stored in the node.
     - `next`: Pointer to the next node in the list.

2. **Function: Create New Node**
   - Create a new node with the given `value`.
   - Set `next` to `NULL`.
   - Return the newly created node.

3. **Function: Insert Value at Beginning**
   - Create a new node with the given `value`.
   - Set the new node’s `next` to the current head node.
   - Update the head of the list to the new node.

4. **Function: Insert Value at End**
   - If the list is empty (head is `NULL`), set the head to a new node with the given `value`.
   - Otherwise, start at the head node:
     - Traverse to the last node (where `next` is `NULL`).
     - Set the last node’s `next` to the new node with the given `value`.

5. **Function: Delete Node by Value**
   - If the list is empty (head is `NULL`), return (nothing to delete).
   - If the head node’s `value` matches the given `value`, update the head to the next node.
   - Otherwise, start from the head and traverse the list:
     - For each node, check if `node.next.value` matches the given `value`.
     - If found, update `node.next` to `node.next.next` (removes the node).
   - If the node is not found, return `NULL`.

6. **Function: Search Value in List**
   - Start from the head node:
     - If `node.value == value`, return the node (value found).
     - Otherwise, move to the next node (`node = node.next`).
   - If the end of the list is reached (`node == NULL`), return `NULL`.

7. **Function: Traverse the List**
   - Start from the head node:
     - While the current node is not `NULL`:
       - Print the node’s `value`.
       - Move to the next node (`node = node.next`).

8. **Function: Get Length of List**
   - Initialize a counter `length = 0`.
   - Start from the head node:
     - While the current node is not `NULL`:
       - Increment the counter.
       - Move to the next node.
   - Return the `length`.

9. **Main Function**
   - Initialize `head` as `NULL`.
   - For each value to be inserted at the beginning:
     - Call `Insert Value at Beginning`.
   - For each value to be inserted at the end:
     - Call `Insert Value at End`.
   - For each value to be searched:
     - Call `Search Value` and print the result.
   - For each value to be deleted:
     - Call `Delete Node by Value`.
   - Perform a traversal to print the list.

### Summary of the Approach
- A **Singly Linked List** is a linear data structure where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node.
- Operations like insertion, deletion, and searching are efficient in terms of accessing specific nodes, with time complexity `O(n)` for searching and deletion.
- The list’s flexibility comes from its dynamic structure, allowing nodes to be added or removed easily without needing to reallocate memory for the entire structure.
