- We can use Kaggle, which offers datasets and Jupyter notebooks for machine learning, alongside Google Colab, which provides GPUs for deep learning.
- While deep learning typically requires powerful GPUs, Google Colab serves our learning needs with its available GPU resources.
- However, we need to import datasets from Kaggle.
## Here, I have mentioned how to import the dataset from the kaggle to the google colab.

## Process to Upload the dataset in Google colab from the kaggle directly.
- Go to the kaggle account and create a new token

- Kaggle.json file will be downloaded in the sytem.
- Upload that file in Google colab
- pending
