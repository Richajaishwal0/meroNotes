## 🎯 **HackerRank SQL Track**

🔗 [https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql)

---

### 💡 Why HackerRank is the **best one-stop choice**

✅ **Structured Path** — divided into:

* *Basic Select*
* *Advanced Select*
* *Aggregation*
* *Basic Join*
* *Advanced Join*
* *Alternative Queries*

✅ **Hands-on practice** — you write and run real SQL queries, not just read theory.
✅ **Instant feedback** — you see test cases and results right away (like in actual interviews).
✅ **Company-style environment** — ServiceNow and many others use HackerRank for SQL assessments.
✅ **Difficulty progression** — problems get tougher gradually, so it’s easy to finish in 5 days.

| **Day 2** | Filtering + sorting + string patterns | [Advanced Select](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql/advanced-select)                         | Use LIKE, BETWEEN, IN, string/date filtering   |
| **Day 3** | Aggregations                          | [Aggregation](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql/aggregation)                                 | Practice COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING     |
| **Day 4** | Joins                                 | [Basic Join](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql/join)                                         | Learn INNER, LEFT, RIGHT JOIN, ON clause       |
| **Day 5** | Subqueries + combined logic           | [Advanced Join / Alternative Queries](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql/alternative-queries) | Practice nested queries, UNION, EXISTS         |

### 🧩 Pro Tip

At the end of each day, take 2–3 random problems from the previous section and re-solve them **without hints**.
By Day 5, you’ll have the muscle memory for query building — perfect for ServiceNow’s QA rounds.
