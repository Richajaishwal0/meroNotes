## To implement this project end-to-end (including backend logic, AI/NLP matching, and a GUI), here’s a clear list of all the **skills and technologies you need to learn**, divided into **core areas**.
## 🔧 1. **Python Programming**


📚 Topics to review:

* `os`, `pathlib` – for file and folder access
* `re` (regex) – for text cleaning (optional)

---

## 📊 2. **Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)**

These are essential for:

* Reading CSV files (like O\*NET data)
* Manipulating job/resume data
* Handling vectors, scores, and matching

📚 Learn:

* `pd.read_csv()`, `df.loc`, `df.groupby()`
* NumPy arrays & basic operations

---

## 📖 3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – 🔥 Core of Your Project

You'll use **NLP** to extract useful words/phrases from resumes and match them to job skills.

📚 Learn:

| Concept                   | Library                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Noun Phrase Extraction    | `TextBlob`  [reference](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html)                          |
| Tokenization, POS tagging | `TextBlob`, `spaCy`  [reference1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/spacy-sentiment-analysis-easy-way-analyze-text-vitor-mesquita-zo83f/) [reference2](https://spacytextblob.netlify.app/)            |
| Sentence Embedding        | `sentence-transformers`               |
| Semantic Similarity       | `cosine similarity`, `util.cos_sim()` |

🛠 Tools:

* `textblob` – simple resume phrase extraction
* `sentence-transformers` – convert text into **vectors** and compute similarity

---

## 🤖 4. **Machine Learning Concepts** (Light)

Since you're familiar with ML, this project is more NLP-heavy, but still:
📚 You should understand:

* Vectors & embeddings
* Similarity metrics: **Cosine similarity**, Euclidean distance
* Threshold-based classification (e.g., 0.65 similarity means "good match")

---

## 🗂️ 5. **O\*NET Data Structure**

You must know how to:

* Navigate & load O\*NET database CSV files
* Understand entities like: **Skills, Abilities, Knowledge, Tools, Technology**
* Map resume skills → O\*NET skills

📚 Learn:

* How to read a large CSV
* How to use `groupby`, `merge`, or custom logic to process jobs

---

## 🌐 6. **Streamlit** (GUI for ML Apps)

This will power your front-end interface.

📚 Learn:

* `st.title()`, `st.file_uploader()`, `st.button()`, `st.text()`
* Display lists, scores, charts
* Run command: `streamlit run your_app.py`

---

## 📡 7. (Optional) API Integration

If you want to recommend courses using Udemy/Coursera:

📚 Learn:

* Basics of **REST APIs**
* How to use `requests` library
* How to read API responses (usually in JSON)

---

## 🧪 8. (Optional) Testing & Debugging

To keep your code bug-free:

* Use `print()` and `st.write()` to debug
* Learn how to write modular functions
* Optionally: Learn `unittest` or `pytest` for testing
