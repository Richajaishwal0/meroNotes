# Face recognization<br>
## Factors<br>
1.CNN<br>
2.Large data sets<br>
## Goals<br>
1. To propose a procedure to create a reasonably large face dataset whilst requiring only a limited amount of person-power for annotation.
2. To investigate various CNN architectures for face identification and verification including exploring face alignment and metric learning, using the novel dataset for training (Section 4)
## Challanges<br>
1.large scale public datasets have been lacking
## Methodology<br>
1. representation of the face image using handcrafted local image descriptors such as SIFT, LBP, HOG .
2. Aggregate such local descriptors into an overall face descriptor by using a
pooling mechanism like Fisher Vector
