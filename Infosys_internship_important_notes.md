### 1. What is Version Control?
Version control is a system that allows you to manage changes to files over time. It enables you to revert to previous versions, making it easier to track modifications and retrieve earlier versions when needed. However, if all changes are stored without proper management, it can become challenging to locate the original version. To address this, we can utilize version control systems such as GitHub, Bitbucket, Azure Repos, and AWS CodeCommit.

### Difference Between Git and GitHub
- **Git**: A version control system that operates locally on your machine. It allows you to manage files as a command-line tool and can be used offline.
- **GitHub**: A cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories, enabling collaboration and sharing among developers.
