1.What is version control?
We can go to the previous version and get it back. Traversing through the versions,
but if we keep everthing in version then it is difficult to find with the original version.
We can use version control systems such as github,bitbucket,Azure,Repos, AWS code storeto overcome that

## Difference between git and github
