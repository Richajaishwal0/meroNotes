### Binary search
 In the binary searching of an element with the time complexity of **O(logn)**,where the initial index is: lets say **start** and the ending index is **end** and suppose we want to find the index in which the new element has to be inserted in the array that is already sorted then, the value of **start** after the completion of the loop
  gives the position where the element has to be inserted.
