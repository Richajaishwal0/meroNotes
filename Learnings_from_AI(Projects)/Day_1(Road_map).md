# Market Maven: AI-Driven Sales Forecasting for Smarter Supermarket

<!-- ## Project Timeline: 45 Days-->

### Week 1: Project Foundation & Data Preparation

1. **Python Basics for Data Science (1-2 Days)**
   - **Goal**: Brush up on Python, focusing on libraries used in data science (Pandas, Numpy).
   - **Resources**:
      - [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) (Chapters on Pandas and Numpy)

2. **Data Collection & Cleaning (3-4 Days)**
   - **Tasks**:
      - Find a dataset with supermarket sales data (try Kaggle, or simulate data if none is available).
      - Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, outliers, data types).
      - Engineer relevant features like day of the week, season, and economic conditions if possible.
   - **Resources**:
      - [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) for data
      - Pandas for cleaning and feature engineering

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (2 Days)**
   - **Tasks**:
      - Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize trends, seasonality, and consumer patterns.
      - Identify high-impact features (e.g., monthly trends, seasonal peaks).
   - **Resources**:
      - [Kaggle’s Data Visualization with Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization)

### Week 2: Initial Model Setup and Training

1. **Simple Forecasting Model (3 Days)**
   - **Goal**: Start with a basic Linear Regression or Decision Tree model to establish a baseline.
   - **Tasks**:
      - Set up and train a simple model using historical sales data.
      - Evaluate using basic metrics (MAE, RMSE).
   - **Resources**:
      - [Scikit-Learn Documentation on Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html)

2. **Time Series Models (4 Days)**
   - **Goal**: Implement time series models like ARIMA or SARIMA to capture seasonality and trends.
   - **Tasks**:
      - Use ARIMA for initial forecasts, focusing on seasonality and trend capture.
      - Compare with baseline model and evaluate improvements.
   - **Resources**:
      - [Intro to Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA](https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-forecasting-with-arima-7f221e9eee06)

### Week 3: Advanced Forecasting Model (LSTM)

1. **Implement LSTM for Time Series (Entire Week)**
   - **Goal**: Train an LSTM model to capture more complex patterns and dependencies in the data.
   - **Tasks**:
      - Set up LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.
      - Preprocess data into sequences (time windows) suitable for LSTM.
      - Train the model and evaluate against previous models.
   - **Resources**:
      - [TensorFlow/Keras LSTM Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series)

### Week 4: Model Tuning and Evaluation

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning (3 Days)**
   - **Goal**: Improve model accuracy through parameter tuning (learning rate, epochs, etc.).
   - **Tasks**:
      - Experiment with different hyperparameters to find the best-performing model.
      - Track performance with RMSE or MAPE to assess accuracy.
   - **Resources**:
      - [GridSearchCV for simpler models](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) or manual tuning for LSTM

2. **Model Comparison and Selection (2 Days)**
   - **Goal**: Choose the best-performing model for deployment.
   - **Tasks**:
      - Compare LSTM results with baseline models.
      - Decide on the model to use based on accuracy and generalization performance.

3. **Prepare Model for Deployment (2 Days)**
   - **Tasks**:
      - Clean up code and prepare it for API integration.
      - Serialize the model (e.g., with joblib or pickle).

---

### Week 5: API Development and Integration

1. **Build Flask API (Entire Week)**
   - **Goal**: Develop an API to serve your model’s predictions.
   - **Tasks**:
      - Create an endpoint to accept input data and return forecasted sales.
      - Test API responses with dummy data to ensure functionality.
   - **Resources**:
      - [Flask Quickstart Guide](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/)

### Week 6: Dashboard and Final Touches

1. **Build a Simple Dashboard (3-4 Days)**
   - **Goal**: Design a minimal dashboard for visualizing predictions.
   - **Tasks**:
      - Use Dash (Python) or basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Flask.
      - Display historical sales data and forecasted results.
   - **Resources**:
      - [Dash User Guide](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction)

2. **Testing & Documentation (3-4 Days)**
   - **Tasks**:
      - Test the entire application with real or simulated data.
      - Write documentation for users and administrators (setup, API use, etc.).
      - Finalize the codebase and ensure all requirements are met.
